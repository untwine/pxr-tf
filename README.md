Library to regroup foundation tool for software development

This repository is a decoupled version of the "tf" library from the
[OpenUSD](https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/release/index.html) library, created
by Pixar.

It is regularly rebased over the "release" branch of the original
[repository](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/OpenUSD) to provide
explicit divergence information from the latest updates and is currently
synchronized with
[v24.08](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/OpenUSD/releases/tag/v24.08).
